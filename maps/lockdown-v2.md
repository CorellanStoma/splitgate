**Map Code:** ``OR0B-V0VY-4OUB-EH47``
**Template:** ``Wet Ocean``
**Author:** CorellanStoma
**Description:** The original map layout is from the game Star Wars: Republic Commando, I got some inspiration from the Environment designs of Halo and Destiny and added the typical splitgate portals. In the end, a whole new level was created.
